1. Build on mac 10.13 is quite easy.

For simple when testing send data, disable encryption:

https://github.com/facebook/wdt/issues/174
Receiver:
wdt -directory ~/Downloads/Received --transfer_id=none --encryption_type=none -start_port 22356
Sender:
wdt -directory ~/Pictures -connection_url "get from console log when run receiver"

2. Build on CentOS 7
+ Need cmake >= 3.2
+ Note to install boost-devel and openssl-devel, otherwise there's no header folder
